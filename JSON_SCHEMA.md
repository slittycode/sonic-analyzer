# JSON Output Schema (`analyze.py`)

This document defines every field currently emitted by `analyze.py`.

Conventions:
- All feature functions are error-safe. On failure they return `null` (JSON `null`) for their container or field set.
- Numeric values are rounded in code; do not assume infinite precision.
- Arrays may be truncated to keep payload size manageable.

## Core Metrics

| Field | Type | Description | Units / Scale | LLM interpretation note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bpm` | `float \| null` | Primary tempo estimate from `RhythmExtractor2013`. | beats per minute | Main tempo anchor for Ableton project tempo and clip warp assumptions. |

| `timeSignature` | `string \| null` | Time signature estimate (currently defaults to `"4/4"` when rhythm exists). | string | Treat as prior; verify manually on odd-metre material. |
| `durationSeconds` | `float \| null` | Track duration from sample count. | seconds | Useful for arrangement section planning and timeline mapping. |

## Additional Notes for LLM Consumers

1. Treat low-confidence outputs as hints, not truth:
- low `melodyDetail.pitchConfidence`
- low `chordDetail.chordStrength`
- low `sidechainDetail.pumpingConfidence`

2. Use cross-field consistency checks:
- tempo: `bpm` vs `bpmPercival` and `bpmAgreement`
- harmony: `key` vs `segmentKey` vs `chordDetail.dominantChords`
- arrangement: `structure` + `segmentLoudness` + `segmentSpectral`

3. Rebuilding in Ableton Live 12 should generally start with:
- project tempo (`bpm`)
- global key (`key`) with manual confirmation
- arrangement locators (`structure.segments`)
- low-end/stereo safety (`stereoDetail`, especially sub-bass fields)
